# Building-Malware-with-C

## About
Just a simple C2 to test and learn, not made for professional use.
The executable is meant to be run on windows, tho i'll upload another simple version for linux in a near future.
Run the server on linux (sorry for the comments in spanish, I'll change them all to english when I have time)

## Requierments:
sudo apt-get install gcc gcc-mingw-w64-i686 python3 -y 

## Installation
Just clone the repository and run the python script (builder.py)

### notes
I'm still working on it so don't expect all the functionalities to work
